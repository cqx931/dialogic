Not saying you should do this but some sort of pattern that shows a progression.. . like: He's curious, then he's in-love, then he's worried his love is unhealthy then it becomes a feretish and he just kinda accepts that.

I think these are good. Not bothering with line suggestions now. but maybe the tendency to have to imagine anything unconciously pushes the chats towards the generic. BUT the actual text of how guppy responds and the details he gives is still room for spicy character/world development. Like small details could be "who/how told him they were nice" or a funny detail about why he sees himself reflected. stuff like that. If you're worried about them being too long you could cut out some of the more generic filer lines. these need some fluffin
